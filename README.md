# DungBeetles

In 2015 I worked on a really cool set of Dung Beetle experiments in Kibale Forest National Park, Uganda.

These experiments looked at the relativ contribution of different 'guilds' of dung beetles to the use of temporary resources (elephant dung).

We'd really hoped to see this published but it was rejected and couldn't rectify the issues.  

I think it deserves to be shared in the hope that someone will find it useful.

I'll make some edits to files in case that is helpful to others.

All work was also worked on and is shared with Aoife leonard, Beryl Maroki, and Johan DuToit.
