# DungBeetles

In 2015 I worked on a really cool set of Dung Beetle experimnets in Uganda.

We'd really hoped to see this published but it was rejected and couldn't rectify the issues.  

Its sat on my computer of years and I think it deserves to be shared in the hope tat someone will find it useful.

I'll make some edits to files in case that is helpful to others.

All work was also worked on and is shared with Aoife leonard, Beryl Maroki, and Johan DuToit.
