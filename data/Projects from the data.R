#### projections #####

## so we have some numbers about how much dung is removed in a set time frame

## can we therefore project what the ecosystem service performed by these insects is per year?
## per area?  
## per elephant?

## would be nice to build some sort of model that really simply estimates this
## linear regression model where you plug your numbers in
## maybe with a shiny app?

## of a predictive model with Python - ML aspect?
# probably not enough data and over doing it
